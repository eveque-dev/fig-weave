# Tavotto telemetry proxy

A small, standard-library-only service that sits between Tavotto clients and the
analytics backend (PostHog).

```
Tavotto (desktop / browser)
   │  privacy-safe event, allowlisted, no provider key
   ▼
telemetry.tavotto.com          ← this service
   │  server-side normalized event, $geoip_disable, no client IP/headers
   ▼
PostHog (US or EU)
```

**It is not part of the Tavotto package.** It is excluded from the wheel and
sdist (`pyproject.toml`), adds no runtime dependency to Tavotto, and the
application only ever knows a URL.

## Why a proxy at all

* The application must not contain a PostHog project key. Anything embedded in an
  open-source desktop app is public; a "secret" there authenticates nobody.
* The provider must be replaceable. Everything PostHog-specific lives in one
  file (`tavotto_telemetry_proxy/posthog.py`), the way the PDF backend is
  confined to one module in the main repo.
* Defense in depth: the client filters events, and the proxy filters them again
  against its own copy of the contract. Neither side trusts the other.
* PostHog sees a request from this service, not from the user's machine, so no
  client IP reaches it as analytics data.

## Layout

```
services/telemetry_proxy/
  tavotto_telemetry_proxy/
    contract.py   event + property allowlists (mirror of the client's)
    core.py       validation, auth, routing — all business logic, platform-neutral
    posthog.py    the ONLY module that knows PostHog's JSON
    wsgi.py       THE entry point: generic WSGI app + `python -m …wsgi` dev server
  pyproject.toml  `[tool.vercel] entrypoint` → wsgi.application
  vercel.json     function limits only (maxDuration) — no routing, no rewrites
  scf_bootstrap   Tencent SCF web-function launcher (runs the same wsgi app)
```

There is **one** entry layer: `wsgi.application`. Vercel runs it directly via
`[tool.vercel]` in `pyproject.toml`; local dev and Tencent SCF run the built-in
server in the same module. The old `api/index.py` + `vercel.json` rewrites were
removed on 2026-08-20 — Vercel's internal rewrites hand the function the
*rewritten* path, so path-routing code passed every local test and 404'd the
whole site once deployed (the lesson is written up at the top of `wsgi.py`).
Swapping hosting providers means pointing the new host at `wsgi.application`.
Nothing else.

## Endpoints

| Route | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /healthz` | none | liveness |
| `POST /v1/events` | none (necessarily public) | product events from desktop clients |
| `POST /v1/metrics` | `Authorization: Bearer $TAVOTTO_METRICS_TOKEN` | distribution snapshots from the scheduled collector |

`/v1/events` enforces: POST only · `Content-Type: application/json` · body ≤ 8 KiB ·
`schema_version` must match · event name on the allowlist · every property on the
allowlist · scalar values only (no nested objects or arrays exist in the schema) ·
bounded integers · bounded string lengths and character sets · `distinct_id` must
be a UUIDv4.

`/v1/metrics` uses a **separate** allowlist, forces the constant distinct ID
`distribution_metrics`, always sets `$process_person_profile: false`, and accepts
a batch of at most 500 events (≤ 256 KiB).

Token comparison uses `hmac.compare_digest`. The token is never echoed in a
response and never logged. When `TAVOTTO_METRICS_TOKEN` is unset the metrics
endpoint is **closed**, not open.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POSTHOG_INGEST_URL` | no | `https://us.i.posthog.com/batch/` | **full** batch-ingest URL. EU: `https://eu.i.posthog.com/batch/`. Self-hosted: your own host + `/batch/`. No region is hardcoded in the code. |
| `POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY` | **yes** | — | the project API key (`phc_…`). Without it the service fails loudly with 502 rather than silently accepting and dropping events. |
| `TAVOTTO_METRICS_TOKEN` | yes for `/v1/metrics` | — | long random string; also set as a GitHub Actions secret. |
| `POSTHOG_PERSON_PROFILES` | no | `identified` | `anonymous` switches product events to `$process_person_profile: false`. See below. |

### Person profiles

Product events are forwarded with person profiles left on, because the anonymous
`distinct_id` *is* the analysis unit and retention/funnel insights are built on
it. Tavotto never calls `identify`, never sets a person property, and never
attaches an email or name — the person record holds a random UUID and nothing
else. Setting `POSTHOG_PERSON_PROFILES=anonymous` makes product events anonymous
(cheaper), at the cost of degrading some person-based insights; upstream does not
enumerate exactly which, so it is not the default. Distribution snapshots are
**always** anonymous regardless of this setting.

### Deduplication

Every forwarded event carries a `uuid`; for distribution snapshots it is
`uuid5(ns, snapshot_key)` so re-running the collector yields the same UUID.
PostHog's public docs do **not** guarantee idempotent dedup on that field, so
every snapshot also carries a stable `snapshot_key` and the dashboard queries
deduplicate on it explicitly (see `docs/analytics/yc-dashboard.json`).

## Deploy

1. **Create or pick a PostHog project.** Product analytics project; no session
   replay, no autocapture (the client sends neither).
2. **Choose a region.** US → `https://us.i.posthog.com/batch/`;
   EU → `https://eu.i.posthog.com/batch/`. Pick before sending data — moving a
   project between regions later is not a config change.
3. **Copy the project API key** (Project settings → Project API key, `phc_…`).
   This key is write-only ingestion, but treat it as a secret anyway.
4. **Set `POSTHOG_INGEST_URL`** to the full batch URL from step 2.
5. **Set `POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY`** to the key from step 3.
6. **Generate `TAVOTTO_METRICS_TOKEN`:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
   ```
   Store it in the host's environment settings. Never in git, never in YAML.
7. **Deploy this directory.** With Vercel:
   ```bash
   cd services/telemetry_proxy
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```
   `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.vercel] entrypoint` hands every route straight to
   `wsgi.application` (no rewrites, no second entry file). There is
   nothing to build — no dependencies, no lockfile.
8. **Map `telemetry.tavotto.com`** to the deployment (host dashboard → Domains →
   add `telemetry.tavotto.com`, then add the CNAME/A record the host shows at
   your DNS provider). Confirm HTTPS is issued, then:
   ```bash
   curl -sS https://telemetry.tavotto.com/healthz
   # {"ok": true, "service": "tavotto-telemetry-proxy"}
   ```
9. **Add the GitHub secret.** Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables →
   Actions → New repository secret: `TAVOTTO_METRICS_TOKEN`, same value as
   step 6. Optionally add repository *variable*
   `TAVOTTO_TELEMETRY_METRICS_URL` if the proxy is not at the default address
   (a URL is not a secret).
10. **Run the collector manually.** Actions → *Distribution metrics* → Run
    workflow. Run it once with `dry_run = true` first and read the printed
    classification, then again for real.
11. **Verify the distribution events arrived** in PostHog: filter on
    `distinct_id = distribution_metrics` and confirm
    `github_release_asset_snapshot`, `pypi_daily_downloads` and
    `github_repo_snapshot`. Spot-check that `asset_role` keeps all four
    groups apart the way `docs/analytics/yc-metrics.md` expects: human
    downloads (`installer` / `plugin` / `wheel` / `sdist`), automated traffic
    (`update_check` / `plugin_manifest` / `updater`), `checksum`, and `other`.
    If `plugin_manifest` shows up folded into `plugin`, the collector is stale —
    `codex-plugin.json` is a poll and outnumbers real package downloads ~677:1.
12. **Test one development client** without touching production:
    ```bash
    TAVOTTO_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=https://telemetry.tavotto.com/v1/events tavotto
    ```
    Opt in when prompted, do one export, and confirm the event appears. To test
    against a *local* proxy instead:
    ```bash
    cd services/telemetry_proxy
    POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY=phc_… POSTHOG_INGEST_URL=https://us.i.posthog.com/batch/ \
      python3 -m tavotto_telemetry_proxy.wsgi          # listens on 127.0.0.1:8787
    # in another shell
    TAVOTTO_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/events tavotto
    ```
13. **Verify no forbidden fields are present.** In PostHog, open a raw
    `export_completed` event and confirm the property list is exactly the
    allowlist plus `$geoip_disable` and `schema_version` — no filename, path,
    stem, prompt, `$ip`-derived geo, or user agent.
14. **Only then ship telemetry-enabled Tavotto builds.**

### Deployment order (matters)

```
1. deploy the proxy with the new schema
2. verify PostHog ingestion
3. configure / run the collector
4. release the Tavotto client
```

The proxy rejects unknown events and unknown `schema_version`s. Releasing a
client that emits an event the deployed proxy has not learned yet means that
event is silently 400'd for as long as the old proxy is live — the client drops
it and nobody notices.

The scheduled collector is louder but was, until 2026-09, no clearer: on
2026-08-27 commit `d2d7187c` added two `asset_role` values to *both* tables in
the repo, nobody redeployed the proxy, and the daily run went red for six days
saying only `HTTP 400` (issue #227). Both tables being in sync **in git** says
nothing about the version that is actually serving traffic.

**Check which contract is deployed before assuming the two sides agree:**

```sh
curl -s https://telemetry.tavotto.com/healthz          # → contract.fingerprint
python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'services/telemetry_proxy'); \
  from tavotto_telemetry_proxy.core import contract_fingerprint as f; print(f())"
```

Different fingerprints mean the deployment is behind `main` — redeploy before
touching the collector. The fingerprint is derived from event and property names
only: no secrets, no deployment details, nothing user-derived, which is why it
is safe on the public health endpoint.

## Deploying to Tencent Cloud SCF (mainland China reachability)

`*.vercel.app` and anything CNAME'd to Vercel is unreachable from mainland China.
The client fails **silently** there (events are dropped, the user notices
nothing), which means mainland users would be invisible in the data rather than
producing errors. If that matters for your numbers, run a second instance on
Tencent Cloud SCF.

The proxy needs no code changes: SCF's **Web function** type just wants a process
listening on `0.0.0.0:9000`, and `scf_bootstrap` in this directory does exactly
that by starting the same `application` used everywhere else.

### The ICP filing fork — decide this first

| Domain | ICP filing | Client change |
|---|---|---|
| API-gateway default third-level domain (`service-xxx.gz.apigw.tencentcs.com`) | not required | **required** — and it hard-codes a provider domain into shipped binaries, the exact thing `DEFAULT_ENDPOINT` avoids |
| `telemetry.tavotto.com` pointed at Tencent Cloud | **required** | none — split-horizon DNS handles it |

Tencent Cloud API Gateway requires any mainland-facing custom domain to have a
valid ICP filing (obtained anywhere, not necessarily at Tencent). Filing needs a
mainland legal entity and typically takes 10–20 working days.

**Recommendation:** if the domain can be filed, do that and split DNS. If it
cannot, do not ship a provider domain inside the client — record the mainland
gap as a known bias in `docs/analytics/yc-metrics.md` instead and revisit when
there is evidence of mainland users to lose.

### Steps

1. **Package.** From this directory:
   ```bash
   zip -r ../proxy-scf.zip . -x '.vercel/*' '.git/*' '__pycache__/*'
   ```
   `scf_bootstrap` must keep its executable bit — `zip` preserves it; building
   the archive on Windows generally does not.
2. **Create the function.** SCF console → 函数服务 → 新建 → **Web 函数**,
   Python 3 runtime, upload the zip. No dependencies to install: the proxy is
   standard library only.
3. **Environment variables**: `POSTHOG_INGEST_URL`, `POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY`,
   `TAVOTTO_METRICS_TOKEN` — the same values as the other deployment, so both
   instances write into one PostHog project.
4. **Trigger**: an API-gateway trigger. Leave the path as `/` with "path
   passthrough" enabled so `/healthz` and `/v1/*` reach the function unchanged —
   the proxy routes on `PATH_INFO`. (Rewriting the path at the gateway is how
   the Vercel deployment first broke; see the WSGI module docstring.)
5. **Verify** against whichever domain you ended up with:
   ```bash
   curl -sS https://<host>/healthz
   ```
6. **Split DNS** (only on the filed-domain path): in DNSPod, give
   `telemetry.tavotto.com` two records — 境内 line → the API gateway, 境外/默认
   line → the Vercel deployment. The client keeps its single hard-coded URL.

### What stays the same

Both instances share one PostHog project and one metrics token, so the
distribution collector can keep pointing at whichever is closest to CI. Event
schema, allowlists and the `snapshot_key` dedup rule are identical — the two
deployments are the same code, not a fork.

## Rate limiting (do this at the edge)

`/v1/events` is necessarily public: a desktop application cannot hold a secret.
The schema, the size cap, the short upstream timeout and the UUID check make
abuse cheap to reject but do not make it impossible. Configure rate limiting at
the hosting/CDN layer, which is where it belongs (a per-process counter is
meaningless on serverless — every instance counts separately):

* `POST /v1/events` — on the order of 60 requests/minute per IP, burst 20.
* `POST /v1/metrics` — a handful per hour; it is called once a day by CI.
* Prefer the platform's built-in WAF/rate-limit rules over anything in this code.

Do not add a fake "app secret" to the client to compensate. It would be public
within a day of the first release and would only make the threat model harder to
reason about.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_telemetry_proxy.py tests/test_distribution_metrics.py
```

They run from the main repository (the proxy is imported by path) and cover
schema rejection, the metrics bearer token, secret leakage in error paths,
header non-forwarding, GeoIP disabling, and **client↔proxy contract parity**.
No test contacts PostHog.
