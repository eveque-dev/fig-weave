# Contributing to Tavotto

Thanks for taking the time. Issues and pull requests are both welcome — a good
bug report is worth as much as a patch.

## Reporting a bug

The most useful thing you can attach is the **diagnostics bundle**: in the app,
**Settings → Privacy, diagnostics and About → Download diagnostics bundle**. It
collects the version, your platform and encoding, how Tavotto was installed,
which Python interpreter is doing the rendering and what matplotlib it has, the
last errors and the log. Keys and personal paths are redacted before it is
written, so it is safe to attach to a public issue.

If the problem involves a specific figure, the *script* is usually more useful
than the PDF — and a cut-down script that still shows the problem is best of all.
Please don't attach unpublished research data; a minimal reproduction with fake
numbers is what we can actually work with.

## Getting set up

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tavotto/Tavotto.git && cd Tavotto
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[worker,dev]"
python scripts/build_frontend.py     # needs node + pnpm
.venv/bin/tavotto
```

`run.sh` does the same thing in one step. Note that there is **no `app.py` at the
repository root** — the entry point is `tavotto` (`src/tavotto/app.py`).

The frontend lives in `web/` (Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4). While
working on it, `pnpm dev` is faster than rebuilding; just remember that a built
`src/tavotto/web/` takes priority over `web/dist`, so after running
`scripts/build_frontend.py` you should either re-run it or delete that directory
to get back to development mode.

## Verifying a change

```sh
ruff check . --fix && ruff format .   # while working: fix, sort, format
ruff check . && ruff format --check . # before pushing: exactly what CI runs
.venv/bin/python -m pytest        # backend
cd web && pnpm test               # frontend (vitest)
cd web && pnpm build              # type-check + bundle
```

**Run `ruff check .` before pytest.** It comes back in about 20 ms for the whole
repository and catches the things that are cheap to find and expensive to wait
for — a misspelled name, an import left behind after a refactor, a local variable
nobody reads. `ruff check . --fix` applies the safe fixes; `--unsafe-fixes` can
change behaviour, so read those one at a time rather than applying them in bulk.
Ruff comes with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.

The rule set lives in `[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml` — deliberately a small,
high-signal one (`E4`, `E7`, `E9`, `F`, `I`) that is meant to stay green rather
than accumulate suppressions. Don't pass `--select` or `--ignore` on the command
line: that would make your run differ from CI's.

Current state: **lint, import sorting and the formatter are all on.**
While working, let Ruff fix things: `ruff check . --fix && ruff format .`.
Before pushing, run the read-only pair `ruff check . && ruff format --check .` —
that is character-for-character what CI runs, so a green local run won't come
back red on formatting. CI never rewrites the tree.

The example gallery, the playground examples and the CompatBench corpus are
**excluded from formatting**: their layout is product content, not our code
style.
`ruff check . --fix` sorts imports for you. First-party packages are recognised
by directory via `[tool.ruff]`'s `src`, which lists the source roots that really
get pushed onto `sys.path` at runtime — if you add a *new* such root, review that
list; adding a module under an existing root needs no config change. See
[docs/ci/ruff.md](docs/ci/ruff.md) for why the formatter is still queued. CI runs the same `ruff check .` as the
`Python lint (Ruff)` job, which feeds the `CI fast gate`.

**Use `pnpm build`, not `tsc --noEmit`, for type checking.** The root `tsconfig.json`
is a solution file (`files: []` + project references); `--noEmit` doesn't follow
project references, compiles nothing, and passes unconditionally. The `tsc -b`
inside `pnpm build` is the real check.

Bigger changes have their own gates:

| Area | How to verify |
|---|---|
| Render engine | `tests/test_equivalence_matrix.py` — hot edit, full replay, fresh worker and reopen-after-write-back must all agree |
| End to end | `python scripts/smoke_app.py --python .venv/bin/python` |
| Desktop build | `python scripts/build_desktop.py`, then `python scripts/smoke_desktop.py --sidecar dist/Tavotto/Tavotto` |
| Golden path in a real browser | `cd web && pnpm e2e` (build the frontend first) |
| Rust supervisor | `cd workerd && cargo test && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check` |
| Telemetry / analytics | `pytest tests/test_telemetry.py tests/test_telemetry_api.py tests/test_telemetry_invariants.py tests/test_telemetry_proxy.py tests/test_distribution_metrics.py` — no test makes a real network request; `tests/conftest.py` pins `TAVOTTO_NO_TELEMETRY=1` |
| Distribution collector | `python scripts/collect_distribution_metrics.py --dry-run` |

Tests that need matplotlib spawn their own interpreter and skip cleanly if there
isn't one, so a `.venv` without the scientific stack still runs most of the suite.

### Working on telemetry

Nothing here needs a PostHog account. The test suites never make a real request:
`tests/conftest.py` pins `TAVOTTO_NO_TELEMETRY=1` for every test, and the telemetry
tests replace the transport with a collector.

```sh
# A local proxy instead of the production one. Validation and rejection paths work
# without a PostHog key; only the final forward needs one.
cd services/telemetry_proxy && python3 -m tavotto_telemetry_proxy.wsgi   # :8787

# Point a dev client at it, then opt in when the first-run prompt appears.
TAVOTTO_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/events tavotto

# Or make sure nothing is ever sent, whatever the saved setting says.
TAVOTTO_NO_TELEMETRY=1 tavotto

# Preview the distribution collector without transmitting anything.
python scripts/collect_distribution_metrics.py --dry-run
```

`TAVOTTO_NO_TELEMETRY` and `TAVOTTO_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` are independent switches; neither
covers the other. The event contract is in
[docs/analytics/telemetry-events.md](docs/analytics/telemetry-events.md) — it is
duplicated on purpose between client and proxy, with a parity test holding the two
copies together. Deployment steps live in
[services/telemetry_proxy/README.md](services/telemetry_proxy/README.md).

## Things that will get a PR sent back

These aren't style preferences — each one is a boundary that took a real bug to
establish. `CLAUDE.md` has the full list with the reasoning.

- **`import pymupdf` outside `src/tavotto/pdfbackend/`.** That package is the only
  module allowed to touch the PDF library; everything above it goes through the
  contract layer in `pdfbackend/__init__.py`. This is what makes the backend
  replaceable, and it matters for licensing.
- **Anything imported by Flask that isn't pure standard library.** `engine/registry.py`,
  `pool.py`, `ai_bridge.py`, `config.py`, `updater.py` and `runtime.py` run in a
  virtualenv that deliberately has no matplotlib. The scientific stack exists only
  in the worker process.
- **Writing to the package directory or the repository root at runtime.** Everything
  writable goes through `engine/config.data_dir()`. Installed as a wheel, site-packages
  isn't writable and this crashes outright.
- **Changing one side of a dual-source pair.** `engine/patchspec.py` ↔
  `workerd/src/patchspec.rs` (byte-identical, pinned by `tests/golden/patch_vectors.json`),
  `web/src/lib/richText.ts` ↔ `src/tavotto/richtext.py`, `web/src/lib/shapeGeometry.ts` ↔
  the geometry in `pdfbackend/pymupdf_backend.py`. Change both, or neither.
- **Adding a Tauri command without updating all three places** — `build.rs`, the
  capability file, and `generate_handler`. Miss the first two and the call is
  **silently** rejected at runtime.
- **`pathlib` in code that reasons about another platform's paths.** `Path()`
  dispatches on `os.name`, so constructing a Windows path on macOS raises. The
  runtime-location logic uses string operations throughout for exactly this reason.

## Two working habits

**A bug that only happens on someone else's computer becomes a test first.**
Encoding (cp936/cp1252), file locking, drive letters and backslashes, non-ASCII
paths, port conflicts, CLI shims — these go into `tests/test_windows_regressions.py`
as a *failing* test before the fix, because macOS and Linux will never reproduce them.

**Measure before optimising.** `docs/perf-baseline.md` holds the numbers and the
method (`python scripts/bench_render.py`). If a change is about performance, point
at a number in there. Two plausible-sounding optimisations are already recorded as
*rejected by measurement* — please don't re-litigate them without new data.

## Pull requests

Branch off `main` and open a PR; CI runs the backend matrix (Linux/macOS/Windows,
Python 3.10 and 3.13), the frontend, packaging, and a real Windows `.exe` smoke test.

The PR template opens with a short "baseline and risk" block — base/head, a risk
tier with its reason, the one thing the PR does, what it deliberately leaves out,
and which contracts it touches. The tier decides how the PR lands; the rules are in
[docs/ci/pr-review-tiers.md](docs/ci/pr-review-tiers.md).

Commit messages and code comments in this repository are written in Chinese;
user-facing text — the README, release notes, the interface — is English first,
with a Simplified Chinese README alongside. Either language is fine in a PR
description. What matters more is that the message says *why*, and that a fix
names the symptom a user would have seen.

## Licence and contributor agreement

**Tavotto is licensed under [AGPL-3.0-only](LICENSE), and that is not changing.**

**You keep the copyright in your contribution.** The Tavotto Contributor License
Agreement gives Tavotto the additional rights needed to keep the community
edition open under AGPL while preserving the option to offer separately licensed
editions.

### What the CLA actually does

You grant Tavotto a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
irrevocable licence to use, modify and distribute your contribution, including
the right to sublicense it. In return Tavotto is bound to keep licensing your
contribution under the licence in force when you submitted it — so the community
edition cannot be closed behind your back.

You keep every right you had before signing, including using and licensing your
own code anywhere else.

### Why it exists

Without it, a contribution accepted only under AGPL-3.0-only can be
redistributed by the project only under AGPL-3.0-only — the maintainers cannot
unilaterally offer it under other terms, because it is your copyright, not
theirs. The CLA lets them continue distributing the same contribution in the
AGPL community edition while retaining the ability to offer separately licensed
editions.

It does not promise that such an edition will exist, that contributors will be
paid, or that any contribution will be merged.

### When it applies

| | CLA needed? |
|---|---|
| Issues, bug reports, feature requests, discussion | **No** |
| Pull requests — code, documentation, design, anything | **Yes** |

Every pull request goes through the CLA process. There is deliberately no
"trivial change" exemption: whether a given diff attracts copyright is a legal
question, and a CI check that tried to guess would be both unreliable and a
constant source of argument. One rule is easier to follow than a boundary
nobody can locate.

A `Contributor licence (CLA)` check enforces this in CI. It qualifies
**everyone in the PR** — the author, every commit author, and every
`Co-authored-by` trailer — not just whoever opened it, and it reports through the
existing `CI fast gate` rather than adding a new required check.

The check reads its policy and agreement texts from the default branch on
purpose — a pull request must not be able to supply the rules that judge it.

### If your employer owns the work

If you are contributing work created in the course of employment, your employer
probably owns the copyright, and you cannot grant these rights on your own. Use
the [Corporate CLA](docs/legal/CLA_CORPORATE.md) instead, which is signed by
someone authorised to bind the company. Corporate agreements are reviewed by a
person, not by CI.

### The agreements

- [Individual CLA](docs/legal/CLA_INDIVIDUAL.md)
- [Corporate CLA](docs/legal/CLA_CORPORATE.md)
- [Why it is versioned and hashed](docs/legal/CLA_VERSIONING.md)
- [The full picture](docs/legal/LICENSING.md)

Both are derived from the [Harmony Agreements](https://www.harmonyagreements.org/)
1.0 templates rather than written from scratch.
The counterparty is **Jiaqi Wan**, a natural person; the governing law is that
of the Hong Kong SAR.

**Current status: the agreements are final at version `1.0`, but no signature
service is connected yet.** That is a deliberate deferral rather than an
omission — there have been no external contributions so far, so there is nothing
for one to collect. Until one is connected, the check qualifies only the rights
holder and two named bots, and blocks everyone else **with an explanation**
rather than pretending they signed. See
[docs/legal/CLA_AUTOMATION_SETUP.md](docs/legal/CLA_AUTOMATION_SETUP.md).

**So if you want to contribute, please open an issue first** — this is a door
that opens by hand at the moment, not a closed one, and it will be sorted out
with you.

### Not a DCO

Tavotto does not use a Developer Certificate of Origin. A DCO certifies
*provenance* — that you had the right to submit the code under the project's
existing licence. It is not a copyright grant and cannot support separately
licensed editions, so it is not a substitute for a CLA and is not treated as
one here.

## Trademark

The AGPL covers copyright, not the name. See [TRADEMARKS.md](TRADEMARKS.md) —
forks are welcome and may say they are based on Tavotto; what they should not do
is present themselves as the official one.
